Hello everyone, and welcome to my channel.

What you see on your screen is a piece of glass, that I mounted recently on a wall in my room. As you can see that the wall color behind the glass is quite light, so, my intention is therefore to use this glass for writing and may be even make use of it to make educational videos for youtube. We will see how it goes.

To be honest, I was actually looking for a magnetic whiteboard, but upon searching I found them to be on the expensive side. I therefore considered going with a white glassboard instead. When I searched for the board in the market, I found out that glass whiteboards are infact as expensive as magnetic whiteboards, and in some cases they were even more expensive than magnetic whiteboards. I am not sure, but, perhaps it's due to the reason that they are made of toughened glass. Now, since the boards were expensive, I decided to look for a writing board in the used market. While I could not find whiteboards or glassboards, I did discover lot of glass scrap in the market. So the choice I made was guided by pure economics.

The piece of glass that you see here is a transparent piece, so it is quite unlike the white glassboards that you may have seen in offices or in the market, in fact some whiteglassboards sold in the market even have magnetic capability and this doesn't have that either. In size, it's just shy of 5 feet length and is slightly over 2 and a half feet in width. It measures 12mm thick, is toughened and weighs 45kgs. Yes, you heard that right, it weighs 45 kgs. I will be making another video to let you know how I went about installing it, my mistakes and the hardware that I used. Now, I purchased this glass from a person who had recently constructed his house and he had a few extra unused pieces left with him after construction was complete. Since the glass was not cut to be used as a glassboard, you can see that it has four holes around the corners which eat away some of the writing surface area. Also, at 12mm thickness it's almost double the thickness of what most sellers sell as glassboard. Also, it's an odd size and you would not find a board of such proportions in the market. In this particular video, I want to discuss a few drawbacks and benefits of using glass vis a vis white board, so let's begin.

Let's start with the drawbacks first..

Glass actually gets quite heavy as the size and thickness increases. It was no easy task for me to handle 45 kgs and I did it all on my own. So if you don't have help of machines or people, and are considering a piece that weighs anything more than 15kgs, I would suggest you, not to do it on your own and purchase it from the glass whiteboard seller instead, since it's likely to come with installation service. If you still wish to do it on your own, keep in mind the size that you would be working with and if you would be able to handle it with ease. On the otherhand, a normal whiteboard would weigh may be 15kgs max, even if you go with the largest size say of 5 feet x 4 feet etc. Another thing to consider is that if you drop glass it will shatter or even worse, you may end up hurting yourself. While in case of whiteboard chances of hapenning that are nil.

Mounting a heavy piece of glass would require special mounts, while these are inexpensive, but, you will need to take proper care during installation, because Glass may prove to be less forgiving, if you deviate from hole position by large amount. So keeping it horizontal and properly aligned can be somewhat of a challenge. In the case of whiteboard however, it can be hung with just two or three dry wall screws, and keeping it aligned properly should also be less of an issue too.

The way in which transparent glass is mounted against the wall, By that I mean how much distance it has between it self and the wall,  this distance directly affects the visibility of the text. It's better if you can get a glass with painted white background. I will not suggest a transparent glass for writing if you are considering making videos since text shadow appears on the wall under certain light conditions and can be problematic for shooting videos. Also, the thinner the glass, the better it will be in terms of text visibility. 

The problem of reflection is another major issue that you are likely to face and it makes a glassboard a less than ideal choice if you are planning on using it in videos. To prevent reflection, you will need to experiment with lot of camera angle or you may need to mount the glass at an angle. Now, This may work, or may not work. I am not so sure since I havent tried it myself.

If you choose to go with a transparent glass instead of a white glass, you may require markers with high flowrate. Here in the picture, you can see comparison of markers from Hauser and Flair. I am not sure if it's visible in the video or not, but Flair appears to be comparatively darker in comparison to the Hauser and I consider it's likely because of higher flowrate since both have same type of writing tip and both are absolutely new markers. In case of whiteboard, you may not face issues with text visibility at all.

Now let's talk about the plus points of glass.

In my personal opinion, a glass board is more suitable for a room if you wish to keep it for an extented period of time. It is not prone to degradation due to moisture. The same cannot be said for other boards since they use some sort of wood substrate as base material. Glass is aesthetically more pleasing to look at, you can write on it and it doubles up as an art installation of sorts. I can't say that about a whiteboard.

Glass is a completely non-porous material and therefore writing experience in comparison to some of the inexpensive whiteboards will definitely be better.

What's the remedy for low visibility?

Now, the visibilty is indeed a major issue with a transparent glassboard, and it is definitely not as great as a whiteboard. To remedy this low visibility, you can paste white chartpapers at the back side of the glass, or you can spray paint it using white enamel. If you choose to use enamel paint, I consider that a spray can would be better as it would provide a much even coat and would be easier to apply.

Economics / Glass installation

Purchasing a new piece of toughened glass and making a board out of it would be as expensive as buying a readymade board, and for that reason it makes no sense in my opinion. I would therefore encourage you to look glass at your nearest scrapyard. In India, I have observed that most modern houses use a lot of glass and due to the construction boom, you may find that glass scrap is quite abundant. The toughened glass scrap specifically is quite abundant, because it is comparatively difficult to work with, and is cut using waterjet machines. So, small pieces generally don't make their way back to machines again for modification, and are sold as is. The shape however may be somewhat odd and it may have undesirable holes as is the case with mine. Generally you should be able to use the holes to your advantage and install some wooden attachments and make them work as place for keeping markers, duster etc. as I have tried to show in this particular image

Here's the summary of things along with prices that I used to make this work.

Glass price 1000 Rs (approx 95 / sqft)

Fasteners M6 Bolt 20 Rs

Mild steel Angle 300 Rs

Stainless steel studs and dry wall screws 140

Drill bit 8mm (For metal) 70 Rs

Drill bit 8mm (For wall) 50 Rs

If you have some of the other common tools like Drill machine, Hammer, Screw driver set, Spanner set etc. this small project should be really easy to execute in my opinion.
